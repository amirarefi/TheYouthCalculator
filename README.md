---This web app gives users an overview of where they are in their life with the purpose of encouraging them to make the most of their life--

After entering the date of birth, gender and region, the program first calculates the exact age of the user in years, months and days. It then uses the users input and calculated age against the available life span statistics in different regions of the world for men and women and shows 3 life bars.

The first (red) shows the percentage of the users life that has been passed, the second bar (Green) shows the percentage of the users optimal life (the youth) remaining. The program then shows the third bar (orange) that illustrates the percentage of user's life than will most likely be spent in retirement.

Results are rounded and are estimates only.Calculations are based on WHO age expectancy data for various regions published in 2013. Ages of 45, 55 and 60 have been used as benchmarks for the onset of 'older' age for Africa, Middle east/South East Asia and the rest of the world respectively based on published WHO resources and other publications.Â©2015 A.A
